                <h2>1) Next-Gen Heart Monitoring</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Comprehensive Health Alerts via GSM and Mobile Integration</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death worldwide, often going undetected due to delayed diagnosis.
                    This project develops a wearable heart monitoring system using sensors, microcontrollers, and GSM technology to provide 
                    real-time health alerts via SMS, even in remote areas.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <strong>Case Study:</strong> A rural heart patient suffered unnoticed complications. A GSM-based alert system 
                    could have prevented severe deterioration by notifying caregivers early.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The system includes an Arduino Uno, MAX30102 pulse oximeter, DS18B20 temperature sensor, and SIM800L GSM module, 
                    ensuring continuous monitoring without internet dependency.
                </p>

                <h2>2) Instant Blood Donation App</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>A Mobile Application for Real-Time Matching of Blood Donors and Recipients</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Blood shortages cause delays in emergency treatments and surgeries due to the difficulty of finding suitable donors quickly.
                    The Instant Blood Donation App solves this by using GPS-based real-time matching to connect donors with recipients instantly.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <strong>Case Study:</strong> The 2015 Nepal earthquake highlighted the urgent need for real-time donor tracking to prevent 
                    avoidable deaths caused by blood shortages.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The app features real-time donor tracking, emergency alerts, and Google Maps integration, ensuring fast access to blood. 
                    By enhancing donor participation, this app can revolutionize emergency response.
